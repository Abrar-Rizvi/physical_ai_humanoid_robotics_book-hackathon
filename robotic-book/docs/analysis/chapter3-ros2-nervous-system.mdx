# Chapter 3: ROS 2 as the Robot's Nervous System

This chapter introduces the Robot Operating System (ROS) 2, the software framework that acts as the central nervous system for our robotic systems.

## What is ROS 2?

ROS 2 is a set of software libraries and tools that help you build robot applications. It provides services you would expect from an operating system, including hardware abstraction, low-level device control, implementation of commonly-used functionality, message-passing between processes, and package management.

## Core ROS 2 Concepts

The communication in ROS 2 is based on a graph architecture. The key concepts are:

-   **Nodes:** A node is an executable that uses ROS 2 to communicate with other nodes. Think of it as a single-purpose program in your robotic system (e.g., a node for controlling a wheel, a node for reading a sensor).

-   **Topics:** Nodes communicate with each other by publishing messages to topics. A topic is a named bus over which nodes exchange messages.

-   **Services:** For request/response communication, nodes can use services. One node offers a service, and another node can call that service.

-   **Actions:** For long-running tasks, ROS 2 provides actions. Actions are like services, but they provide feedback during execution and are preemptible.

This chapter will walk through creating and running simple nodes to demonstrate these concepts.

## Example: Publisher and Subscriber

Here is a pseudo-code example of a simple publisher and subscriber node in Python.

<CodeExample title="publisher_subscriber_pseudo.py">
```python
# This is pseudo-code, not runnable Python.
# It illustrates the structure of a simple ROS 2 publisher and subscriber.

# --- Publisher Node ---

# Import necessary ROS 2 libraries
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from std_msgs.msg import String

class MyPublisher(Node):

    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize the node with the name 'my_publisher'
        super().__init__('my_publisher')

        # Create a publisher on the 'chatter' topic
        # The message type is String
        # The queue size is 10
        self.publisher_ = self.create_publisher(String, 'chatter', 10)

        # Create a timer that calls the 'publish_message' callback every 0.5 seconds
        timer_period = 0.5
        self.timer = self.create_timer(timer_period, self.publish_message)
        self.i = 0

    def publish_message(self):
        # Create a new String message
        msg = String()
        # Set the data of the message
        msg.data = f'Hello World: {self.i}'
        # Publish the message
        self.publisher_.publish(msg)
        # Log the published message to the console
        self.get_logger().info(f'Publishing: "{msg.data}"')
        self.i += 1

def main(args=None):
    # Initialize the ROS 2 Python client library
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    # Create an instance of the publisher node
    my_publisher = MyPublisher()
    # 'spin' the node so its callbacks are called
    rclpy.spin(my_publisher)
    # Destroy the node explicitly
    my_publisher.destroy_node()
    # Shutdown the ROS 2 client library
    rclpy.shutdown()

# --- Subscriber Node ---

class MySubscriber(Node):

    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize the node with the name 'my_subscriber'
        super().__init__('my_subscriber')
        # Create a subscriber on the 'chatter' topic
        # The callback function 'listener_callback' is called when a message is received
        self.subscription = self.create_subscription(
            String,
            'chatter',
            self.listener_callback,
            10)
        self.subscription  # prevent unused variable warning

    def listener_callback(self, msg):
        # Log the received message to the console
        self.get_logger().info(f'I heard: "{msg.data}"')

def main_subscriber(args=None):
    # Initialize rclpy
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    # Create the subscriber node
    my_subscriber = MySubscriber()
    # Spin the node
    rclpy.spin(my_subscriber)
    # Destroy the node and shutdown rclpy
    my_subscriber.destroy_node()
    rclpy.shutdown()
```
