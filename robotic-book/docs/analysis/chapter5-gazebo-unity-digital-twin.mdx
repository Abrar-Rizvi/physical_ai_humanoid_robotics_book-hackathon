# Chapter 5: Creating Digital Twins with Gazebo and Unity

Simulation is a critical tool in robotics, allowing us to test and validate our designs in a virtual environment before deploying to physical hardware. This chapter introduces two powerful simulation platforms: Gazebo and Unity.

## What is a Digital Twin?

A digital twin is a virtual model of a physical object or system. In robotics, this means creating a high-fidelity simulation of our robot and its environment. This allows us to test everything from basic movement to complex AI algorithms in a safe, repeatable, and cost-effective manner.

## Robot Models with URDF

Before we can simulate a robot, we need to describe it. The Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) is an XML format for representing a robot model.

Here is an example of a simple two-wheeled robot described in URDF:

<CodeExample title="simple_robot.urdf">
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<robot name="simple_robot">

</robot>

## Gazebo for ROS 2 Integration

Gazebo is a popular open-source robotics simulator that is tightly integrated with ROS. It provides realistic physics simulation and a wide range of sensor models.

Key features of Gazebo include:
-   Excellent ROS 2 integration.
-   A large library of pre-built robot models and environments.
-   A plugin-based architecture for extending its functionality.

We will walk through the process of launching a simple robot in a Gazebo world.

## Unity for High-Fidelity Visualization

Unity is a powerful game engine that can also be used for robotics simulation. It excels at creating visually stunning and complex interactive environments.

Key features of Unity for robotics include:
-   High-quality graphics and rendering.
-   A rich asset store for environments and models.
-   The Unity Robotics Hub for integration with ROS 2.

This chapter will provide an overview of how Unity can be used to create compelling digital twins for robotics.
