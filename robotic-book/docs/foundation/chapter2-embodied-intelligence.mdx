# Chapter 2: Embodied Intelligence

This chapter delves deeper into the concept of Embodied Intelligence, building upon the fundamentals of Physical AI discussed in Chapter 1.

## The Embodiment Thesis

The core idea of embodied intelligence is that an agent's body plays a critical role in its cognitive processes. Intelligence is not just a property of the "brain" but is a result of the dynamic interaction between the brain, the body, and the environment.

## Morphological Computation

One of the most fascinating aspects of embodied intelligence is morphological computation. This is the idea that the physical structure (morphology) of a robot can be designed to perform computations that would otherwise have to be done by the brain.

For example, a well-designed leg can have a natural swing that simplifies the act of walking, offloading the computation from the controller to the physical body.

## From Subsumption to Deep Learning

The history of embodied AI has seen several architectural shifts:

- **Subsumption Architecture:** A reactive, layer-based approach where simple behaviors are combined to produce more complex ones.
- **Deep Learning:** Modern approaches often use deep neural networks to learn sensorimotor control directly from data.

This chapter will provide a brief overview of these historical and modern approaches.
