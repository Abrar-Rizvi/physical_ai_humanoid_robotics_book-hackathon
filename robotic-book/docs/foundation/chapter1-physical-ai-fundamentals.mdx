# Chapter 1: The Fundamentals of Physical AI

This chapter introduces the core concepts of Physical AI, exploring how intelligence is embodied in robotic systems that can perceive and act upon the physical world.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to artificial intelligence that is not confined to the digital realm. It is intelligence that can sense its environment, process information, and physically interact with the world. This is a departure from traditional AI, which often operates on abstract data.

## The Sense-Plan-Act Cycle

A fundamental concept in Physical AI is the Sense-Plan-Act cycle. This is a continuous loop that a robot performs to operate in the world.

1.  **Sense:** The robot gathers information about its environment using sensors (e.g., cameras, LiDAR, touch sensors).
2.  **Plan:** The robot's "brain" (the AI) processes this information to make a decision about what to do next.
3.  **Act:** The robot executes the decision by using its actuators (e.g., motors, grippers) to move or interact with its environment.

## Key Components of a Physical AI System

A typical Physical AI system is composed of several key components:

- **Sensors:** The robot's senses.
- **Actuators:** The robot's muscles.
- **Computation:** The robot's brain.
- **Power Source:** The robot's energy supply.

This chapter will provide a high-level overview of each of these components, setting the stage for deeper dives in the chapters to come.
