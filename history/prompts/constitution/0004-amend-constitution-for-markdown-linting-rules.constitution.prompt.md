## Prompt

/sp.constitution updateAdd to Constraints section:- Allow line length up to 200 characters in all .md files generated by SpecKit- Allow flexible list indentation (2 or 4 spaces) in specs/tasks- Disable MD013/line-length and MD007/ul-indent errors in lint/spellcheck workflow- Keep code quality high but don't block merge on formatting in specs folder

## Response snapshot

I have updated the constitution to version 1.3.0 and amended the linting rules as requested.

- Modified `.markdownlint.jsonc` to set `line_length` to 200 and disable `MD007`.
- Updated `.specify/memory/constitution.md` to reflect these new standards under a "Markdown & Linting Style" section and incremented the version.

A commit message suggestion is: `docs: amend constitution to v1.3.0 (markdown linting rules)`

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The project constitution and linting rules were updated to allow more flexible formatting for Markdown files, specifically increasing the line length and relaxing indentation rules. This makes it easier to write complex specification documents.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run as this was a documentation and configuration change.
- 📁 Files: 
  - `.specify/memory/constitution.md`
  - `.markdownlint.jsonc`
- 🔁 Next prompts: None
- 🧠 Reflection: The process of updating the constitution and related linting files was straightforward. The fallback mechanism for creating the PHR worked as expected when the shell script wasn't available for my environment.
