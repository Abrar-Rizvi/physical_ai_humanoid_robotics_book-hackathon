## Summary

- Restore the original main.py file that contains the complete RAG embeddings pipeline
- This file was previously in the book-backend directory before it was deleted
- The pipeline extracts content from URLs, chunks text, generates Cohere embeddings, and stores in Qdrant
- Includes CLI interface and complete functionality for the RAG pipeline

## Test plan

- [ ] Verify main.py functionality works as expected
- [ ] Test the RAG embeddings pipeline with sample URLs
- [ ] Confirm all dependencies are properly handled
